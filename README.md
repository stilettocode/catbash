# Cat Bash

Bash with cats. Modeled after Git Bash, with Linux-style commands and updated every once in a while with more commands as I find some that I haven't added yet. Includes a quantized Gemma LLM model included in the CLI, prompted by starting your command with "yo."

i.e,

```bash
cat-bash$ yo what's the command for pushing my latest commits again 

CATBOT:
git push <remote> <branch>
```


## Installation/Usage

Download the .exe for Cat Bash + the dll's necessary for running llama.cpp in the "releases" tab into the same directory. Running Cat Bash should just be a matter of double clicking the .exe.

Note: Compiled for Windows systems
